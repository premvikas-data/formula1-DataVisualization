# Formula 1 Data Visualization Project 🏎️

This project explores the intricate and data-intensive world of Formula 1 racing through advanced data visualizations. Using Python, Plotly, and GIS techniques, the project reveals hidden patterns related to driver performances, race outcomes, pit stop efficiencies, and seasonal dynamics.

## Key Visualizations
- 📈 Line chart of drivers' rankings across seasons
- 🌍 Geographic map of driver victories by circuit
- ⏱️ Scatter Mapbox showing quickest pit stops at each track
- 🏆 Interactive bar charts of drivers' career achievements
- 🗺️ GIS visualization of race locations by season
- 🧯 3D bubble chart mapping racing incidents per track

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GIS Mapping (Plotly Mapbox)
- Ipywidgets for interactivity

## Data Source
- Formula 1 dataset sourced from Kaggle and the Ergast Developer API.

## Future Enhancements
- Build a comprehensive track analytics database.
- Visualize historical driver rivalries and team strategies.
